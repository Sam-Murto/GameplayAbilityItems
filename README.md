# Gameplay Ability Items

## Running
Binaries are included so compilation is not required, though anyone using GAS will need to use C++ at some point

## Getting Started
<p> Included in this sample project are a few ability items to show simple examples of easy to make items (a pistol, a machine gun, and a bow and arrow). The plugin itself is found in the plugins folder. </p>
